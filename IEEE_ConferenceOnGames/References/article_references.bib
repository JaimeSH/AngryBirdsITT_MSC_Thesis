In this paper we present a genetic algorithm used for feature selection with a Feature Quality Index (FQI) metric. We generate feature vectors by defining fuzzy sets on Hough transform of character pattern pixels. Each feature element is multiplied by a mask vector bit before reaching the input of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The genetic algorithm operates on the bit string represented by the mask vector to select the best set of features. The method has been tested with three benchmark data sets and the results show a fast convergence of the genetic algorithm. A Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in a Neuro-Fuzzy.},

Levels are created using a grammar-based method: first generating rhythms, then generating geometry based on those rhythms. Generation is constrained by a set of style parameters tweakable by a human designer. The approach also minimizes the amount of content that must be manually authored, instead relying on geometry components that are included in the level designer's tileset and a set of jump types. Our results show that this method produces an impressive variety of levels, all of which are fully playable.},

abstract = {Of all the issues discussed at Alife VII: Looking Forward, Looking Backward, the issue of whether it was possible to create an artificial life system that exhibits open-ended evolution of novelty is by far the biggest. Of the 14 open problems settled on as a result of debate at the conference, some 6 are directly, or indirectly related to this issue. Most people equate open-ended evolution with complexity growth, although a priori these seem to be different things. In this paper I report on experiments to measure the complexity of Tierran organisms, and show the results for a size-neutral run of Tierra. In this run, no increase in organismal complexity was observed, although organism size did increase through the run. This result is discussed, offering some signposts on path to solving the issue of open ended evolution.},

abstract = {The Angry Birds AI Competition (aibirds.org) has been held annually since 2012 in conjunction with some of the major AI conferences, most recently with IJCAI 2015. The goal of the competition is to build AI agents that can play new Angry Birds levels as good as or better than the best human players. Successful agents should be able to quickly analyze new levels and to predict physical consequences of possible actions in order to select actions that solve a given level with a high score. Agents have no access to the game internal physics, but only receive screenshots of the live game. In this paper we describe why this problem is a challenge for AI, and why it is an important step towards building AI that can successfully interact with the real world. We also summarise some highlights of past competitions, including a new competition track we introduced recently.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our design of a generator for automatically generating fun levels in the famous game Angry Birds and its clone games. In particular, we aim at generation of character-sequence levels. In order to generate fun levels, we propose a pattern-struct approach and a preset-model approach. The pattern-struct approach generates each time different appearance for one of the alphabetical letters, numeral numbers, or some symbols. The preset-model approach is used for increasing the legibility and diversity, where models are built in advance for some capital letters and numbers. Our level generator, called Funny Quotes, was the winner of the Fun Track of the CIG 2016 Level Generation Competition held in 2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games. After raising issues residing in Funny Quotes through user-evaluation results in terms of legibility of characters in generated levels and of playability of those levels, we propose and evaluate new mechanisms for ensuring the disparity in difficulty among easy, normal, and hard levels for the 2017 competition.},

@article{Taylor,
abstract = {This paper presents a high-level conceptual framework to help orient the discussion and implementation of open-endedness in evolutionary systems. Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al., three different kinds of open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational. These are characterised in terms of their relationship to the search space of phenotypic behaviours. A formalism is introduced to describe three key processes required for an evolutionary process: the generation of a phenotype from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and the reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The distinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these processes. A discussion then investigates how various interactions between these processes, and their modes of implementation, can lead to open-endedness. However, an important contribution of the paper is the demonstration that these considerations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the implementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness - expansive and transformational - are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple domains of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional systems. These factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of individuals and populations, but rather to the nature of the building blocks out of which individual organisms are constructed, and the laws and properties of the environment in which they exist. The paper ends with suggestions of how the framework can be used to categorise and compare the open-ended evolutionary potential of different systems, how it might guide the design of systems with greater capacity for open-ended evolution, and how it might be further improved.},

abstract = {This paper describes the creation of the game Endless Web, a 2D platforming game in which the player's actions determine the ongoing creation of the world she is exploring. Endless Web is an example of a PCG-based game: it uses procedural content generation (PCG) as a mechanic, and its PCG system, Launchpad, greatly influenced the aesthetics of the game. All of the player's strategies for the game revolve around the use of procedural content generation. Many design challenges were encountered in the design and creation of Endless Web, for both the game and modifications that had to be made to Launchpad. These challenges arise largely from a loss of fine-grained control over the player's experience; instead of being able to carefully craft each element the player can interact with, the designer must instead craft algorithms to produce a range of content the player might experience. In this paper we provide a definition of PCG-based game design and describe the challenges faced in creating a PCG-based game. We offer our solutions, which impacted both the game and the underlying level generator, and identify issues which may be particularly important as this area matures.},

A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based procedural content generation in particular is situated within this taxonomy.

Personalization of user experience via affective and cognitive modeling, coupled with real-time adjustment of the content according to user needs and preferences are important steps towards effective and meaningful PCG. Games, Web 2.0, interface and software design are amongst the most popular applications of automated content generation. The paper provides a taxonomy of PCG algorithms and introduces a framework for PCG driven by computational models of user experience. This approach, which we call Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation (EDPCG), is generic and applicable to various sub-areas of HCI. We employ games as an indicative example of rich HCI and complex affect elicitation, and demonstrate the approach's effectiveness via dissimilar successful studies.},
